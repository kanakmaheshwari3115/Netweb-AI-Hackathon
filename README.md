# AI-Based Alternative Credit Scoring for Financial Inclusion in India

Our solution is an AI-based alternative credit scoring system that looks beyond traditional credit history to understand how people actually manage their money in everyday life. It uses signals like :
* timely bill payments
* regular mobile recharges
* digital transaction patterns
* spending stability
* work consistency

to estimate the likelihood of loan repayment. 

Instead of simply approving or rejecting applicants, it provides graded risk categories that help lenders offer suitable loan terms. 

With multilingual support, offline functionality, clear explanations for every decision, and continuous learning from new data, the system is designed to be inclusive, transparent, and practical—especially for users underserved by existing credit scoring models.
